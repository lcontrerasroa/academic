<div align="justify">
<p>I am a <b>linguist</b>, an <b>English teacher</b>, and a <b>phonetician</b>.</p>
<p>I initially studied translation in Chile and was passionate about <b>translation analysis</b>&mdash;trying to understand how language structures and ideas are modified when someone translates them from one language to another.</p>
<p>I then became interested in <b>language teaching</b>, so I moved to France. There, I started teaching Spanish and then English. I realized that, just as structures and ideas are transformed when translated, so are the structures and sounds of a language when someone learns it as a <b>second or foreign language</b>.</p>
<p>My research currently consists of analyzing through <b>phonetics</b> how learners acquire the phonemes, rhythm, and intonation of the language they are learning. I particularly enjoy working with big <b>corpora</b> of audio or video data to find regularities and try to make things out of them&mdash;i.e. understanding the way a learner's <b>interlanguage</b> behaves.</p>
